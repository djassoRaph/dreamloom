## What is DreamLoom?

DreamLoom is a community-driven project to create a modern, open-source graphical social world inspired by [Furcadia](https://www.furcadia.com/) — the classic 1996 MMORPG where creativity, roleplay, and community came first.

We're weaving together:
- 🏠 **Cozy isometric worlds** — tile-based environments with nostalgic warmth
- 🎭 **Social & roleplay focus** — conversation and storytelling over combat
- 🎨 **User-created "dreams"** — build and share your own spaces
- 🎲 **Optional RPG mechanics** — character sheets, dice rolls, stats (think Roll20 meets Furcadia)
- 🤖 **AI enhancement** — scene descriptions, NPC dialogue, creation assistance
- 🌐 **Self-hostable shards** — run your own server for your community

## Current Status

🚧 **Phase 0: Foundation** — We're establishing the project structure, core design documents, and building community.

This is the ground floor. If you want to shape what DreamLoom becomes, now is the time to get involved.

## Why DreamLoom?

Furcadia proved that a graphical social world focused on creativity and community could thrive for decades. But it's 2025, and we can do better:

- **Open source** — No corporate gatekeepers. The community owns this.
- **Self-hostable** — Run your own shard with your own rules.
- **Modern tools** — Better text UI (finally!), AI assistance, integrated RPG mechanics.
- **Accessible** — Low system requirements, web client planned.

## Tech Stack (Planned)

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Client | Godot 4.x |
| Server | Rust or Go |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Redis |
| Protocol | WebSocket |
| AI | Local (Ollama) or Cloud APIs |
